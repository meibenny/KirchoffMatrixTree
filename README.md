# KirchoffMatrixTree

This is a really quick and dirty script to calculate the number of spanning trees of a graph using Kirchoff's Matrix Tree Theorem.

The use of this script requires that the user actually knows how the algorithm works as much of it is manual.

More information can be found at Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_theorem
